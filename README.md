# CodeForcesSolutions

This repo will be updated with whatever easy stuff I solved in my first year (Disclaimer : Not a pro!)


Some useful things I learnt :

1) See Code 5 : When you want to take an input like 1032318 as a whole number string, but treat each digit individually (as integers), you should read it as a char array and then convert each character to an integer using:

int_array[i] = char_array[i] - '0';
